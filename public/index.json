Sun was born from a confluence of industry Unix partners and governmental support of university internet research. By using this confluence of knowledge and recent advances in off the shelf components, such as Reduced Instruction Set Computation (RISC) processors from Motorola, Sun was able to build a unique and valuable set of products for hosting internet services (Gomes, 2012). Sun had a marketing plan that included not only great hardware and software, including eventually the creation of the Java language, but also a charismatic personality leader to market new products (Gomes, 2012). However, the technology advancements in central processing units (CPUs) that had initially born startup fruit for SUN using the RISC platform was the same type of technological introduction that eventually became Sun's downfall. In this case, the Intel company was able to advance the performance and with a lower cost of the competing Complex Instruction Set Computation (CISC) processors (CISC vs RISC, n.d.). Intel's innovation and cost reduction lead to Sun Microsystems' downfall as a primary internet provider (Gomes, 2012). Quantum Computers Quantum computing is a technology innovation that has not been fully developed yet. At this beginning stage of innovation development, two competing methodologies of quantum computers have emerged, that of the quantum annealing process and the quantum gate-level process (Eric \u0026 Finke, 2020). Although quantum annealing is not a universal quantum computer, currently optimization problems finding local minima is the specialization. The quantum-gate can solve a border range of problems but can compete in the optimization problem space (Ohzeki, 2020). The D-Wave company is pursuing the quantum annealing with competition from IBM and others seeking the quantum gate-level process for computations (Eric \u0026 Finke, 2020; Linke, et al., 2017). D-Wave needs a sociotechnical plan to compete and ensure the organization's long-term viability, which accounts for the technological force against it from the quantum-gate organizations (Ohzeki, 2020; Baxter \u0026 Sommerville, 2011). D-Wave does not want to repeat the mistakes of Sun Microsystems and not have a technological counter for quantum-gate solutions. Secondly, the economics force will need to be considered an integral part of the sociotechnical plan, as with all computational devices, the cost will be driven downward (Eric \u0026 Finke, 2020).

Play-Doh seems perfectly invented for the use we know and love today, a child safe modeling clay. However, the original intended use or discovery for this substance was as non-vinyl wall paper cleaner. As such, Play-Doh was an example of a discovery made by exaptation (Hiskey, 2015). Exaptation is a term used to describe an invention or discovery of use for a previously found discovery or invention (Ferreira et al., 2020). In the case of Play-Doh, the original Kutol’s wallpaper cleaner was used as modeling clay in a nursery school desperate for cheap material to use for making Christmas decorations (Hiskey, 2015). The story of the discovery of Play-doh is also one of an accidental discovery that repurposed the original invention use. However, accidental discovery have been classified as serendipitous discoveries and so in the case of Play-doh the two intertwine (Ferreira et al., 2020).\nThe term “serendipity” was first used by Horace Walpole in 1794. Serendipity was used to describe discoveries that occurred as the result of an accident or unexpected or unanticipated result from research either in the primary field or an unrelated field (Roberts, 1989). The happy accident for the discovery of pulsars was first made by Jocelyn Bell Burnell while a graduate student at Cambridge University in the field of radio astronomy (Shackle, 2015). The discovery of pulsars, which are neutron stars rotating with a tremendous velocity that emit beams of radio waves, has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century (Burnell, 2004). Additionally, discoveries can be made in error, in other words research down a particular line of methodology or questioning is not accurately followed. A mistake or error is made and an invention or discovery is made by the introduction of this error. A famous example of this process is the breakfast cereal “Wheaties” (Donnelly, 2012). The clumsy dietician at the Washburn Crosby Company spilled bran gruel on a hot stove top and noticed that the gruel turned or baked into flakes. The most surprising outcome from this culinary error was that the flake tasted better than the gruel (Donnelly, 2012). In hind sight, that should not have been that surprising.

To create this set of possible future results, the organization must first identify the driving forces for the organization's desired behavior. These forces can be technology emergence, shifts in economics, or politics, to name a few (Lew, Meyerowitz, \u0026 Svensson, 2018). Next, the organization needs to identify which of the driving forces are more critical to impact the organization. The assignment of a range of possible values for the identified impacting forces should be developed next. Finally, a set of strategies can be developed by the designated organizational scenario planners (Lew, et al., 2018). The primary strength of the scenario planning method is the ability to identify a range of plausible outcomes without the need for a broad set of historical data, either quantitative or qualitative (Amer, Daim, \u0026 Jetter, 2013). However, the information used for the critical driving force ranges of values can be subjective and prone to inaccuracies. Additionally, the initial set of driving forces could be too extensive with biased or subjective strategy session selections from the organizational planners that do not correctly identify possible future states (Lew, et al., 2018). Traditional Forecasting For the process of forecasting, the organization will attempt to collect both quantitative and qualitative data in the service of a prediction formulation. The organization might use surveys or decision-making methodologies, such as the Delphi method for qualitative data (Daim, Rueda, Martin, \u0026 Gerdsri, 2006; Rowe \u0026 Wright, 2001). Business metrics such as time series sales growth or lead-lag indicators could be a few of the quantitative data collection. The prediction formulation will tend to use statistical modeling and data analytics methodologies (Daim et al., 2006). The accuracy of predictions formulated in this traditional forecasting methodology is highly dependent on the veracity of the data and the use of the statical and analytic processes (Wade, 2012). The prediction power of forecasting has been shown to achieve good results for organizations and offers a structured and repeatable process (Wade, 2012). However, the forecasting accuracy will suffer when forces, both external and internal, that shaped the values of historical quantitative and qualitative data, alter significantly in the future. Complementary combination For the organization, planning for the most likely future state or outcome is critical for sustained optimum operations (Wade, 2012). A possible result from the examination of both the strengths and weaknesses of scenario planning and traditional forecasting that benefits the organization is a complementary combination of the two methodologies (Derbyshire \u0026 Giovannetti, 2017). The next section will highlight a case study of energy production forecasting that did not use a complementary combination of traditional forecasting and scenario planning. ExxonMobile Forecasting Case Study The oil company ExxonMobile is part of the energy production industry. Analytical models are the norm from which forecasts are derived in this industry (Muttitt, 2017). An example of an analytical model for energy demand is shown in Figure 1. Forecasting for energy demand is extrapolated from drivers such as population, GDP per capita, and energy intensity. Although the extrapolation gives a quantitative rigor to the model and forecasting process, this process ultimately makes subjective assumptions about trend growth (Muttitt, 2017). These assumptions will tend to mask critical underlying trends that can have dramatic effects for a driver in the model formulation (Muttitt, 2017). As shown in Figure 2, the ExxonMoble energy demand model forecast for oil demand was off by at least 3% for year 2105. A 3% difference between actual and forecast might seem insignificant, but as can be seen in Figure 3, there was an error of at least 9 billion barrels of oil for 2015. ExxonMobile failed to incorporate scenario planning to account for new technology disruptions, such as a rise in alternative energy use and social impacts such as more energy conservation measures. By assuming the future will be like the present, ExxonMobile failed to scenario plan for a world that would need 9 billion fewer barrels of oil (Muttitt, 2017). Figure 1 Energy demand model (Muttitt, 2017) Figure 2 ExxonMobil 2004 to 2015 forecast versus actual (Muttitt, 2017) Figure 3 Chart of world oil consumption in barrels per year (Oil left in the world, n.d.)\nReferences:\n Amer, M., Daim, T.

Dimensions are thought to be necessary for evaluation when making a prediction or forecasting a scenario of possible future outcomes involving technological innovation (Quinn, 2014; Daim, Rueda, Martin, \u0026 Gerdsri, 2006). However, technology should be evaluated as knowledge of relationships, not the physical device. These knowledge relationships often reflect the corroborating or conflicting forces that can impact the success or failure of the predicted outcome for innovation (Quinn, 2014). An excellent example of understanding the impacting forces of technological innovation in predicting the future comes from the science fiction author Issac Asimov. In 1983 Asimov made the following innovation prediction for the year 2019: “The \"mobile computerized object\" will \"penetrate the home,\" and the increasing complexity of society will make it impossible to live without this technology.” (Johnson, 2019). Not only is the prediction wildly accurate for today’s modern lifestyle, but it also identifies the impacting forces of influence (Bradford, 2020). One of the forces is the advancement of technology concerning mobile devices. Even in 1983, the pace for more advanced mobile devices was advancing (Johnson, 2019). The second impacting force was the societal adoption of mobile technology as a means to simplify the increasing complexities of the Information Age lifestyle (Johnson, 2019). In this prediction instance the forces were corroborating in the success of the device a lot of people now refer to as “Hey Alexis” (Bradford, 2020). As a counterpoint to the successful prediction, Asimov’s following prediction: \"By 2019, the first space settlement should be on the drawing boards; and may perhaps be under actual construction,\" was not as successful (Johnson, 2019). In this instance, one of the underlying forces of impact, the technological innovation in space travel, was influenced by the changing management culture of NASA (Howell, 2019). A change in the knowledge relationships of space travel that resulted in a tragedy from which the space travel sector if just now starting to recover (Clark, 2020). References:\nBradford, A.

Serendipity was used to describe discoveries that occurred as the result of an accident or unexpected or unanticipated result from research either in the primary field or an unrelated field (Roberts, 1989). This report illustrates two groundbreaking discoveries in science that happened by accident. One of these discoveries is shown to be the result of the unrelated artistic sensibilities of the scientist. The first is a pure form of a happy accident.\nSerendipitous Discovery of Pulsars The happy accident for the discovery of pulsars was first made by Jocelyn Bell Burnell while a graduate student at Cambridge University in the field of radio astronomy (Shackle, 2015). The discovery of pulsars, which are neutron stars rotating with a tremendous velocity that emit beams of radio waves, has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century (Burnell, 2004). However, the discovery of this very interesting astronomical observance was made by Burnell, noticing a pattern in the noise surrounding the intended astronomical observation subject. Burnell and her advising professor were puzzled by the regularity of the radio pulses that had never before been seen as natural phenomena. At first, the possibility of alien intelligence as a cause for this unnatural observation as hypothesized, but after more searching, for these radio pulses, the events could be seen as natural occurrences (Shackle, 2015). Observations of pulsars lead to a deeper understanding of the life stars and one of the more bizarre outcomes for stars (Burnell, 2004). Radio astronomy is an academic endeavor with a primary motivating force of scientific curiosity. However, even purely academic work needs funding, and the scientific world is ripe with competitive prizes as a secondary force for discovery behaviors (Burnell, 2004). The work for the discovery of pulsars was awarded the first Nobel prize in physics for an astronomical discovery in 1974. Although Burnell was not on the awarded team as she was a student at the time of discovery, she later used this as motivation to inspire other female researchers to join the astronomical sciences (Burnell, 2004). Burnell's discovery, although considered as accidental, could be attributed to the attention to detail she paid in researching her work (Burnell, 2004). This ability to discover science in the peripheral view of the main objective is considered a possible explanation of serendipitous discovery in science-related fields (Roberts, 1989). Serendipitous Discovery of Molecular Chirality Louis Pasteur was made famous in modern society by the discovery of the pasteurization method (Roberts, 1989). As a French microbiologist and chemist, he made significant contributions across these fields. However, it was Pasteur's serendipitous discovery in the field of chemistry that is considered his most significant contribution to science (Flack, 2009). Pasteur was studying tartaric acid at the University of Paris when he noticed a particular symmetry in the tartrates, which ultimately lead to the field of molecular chirality (Gal, 2017). His discovery is considered surprising or serendipitous as he was new to this field of study, being only 25 years of age and just a few months from finishing his doctorate. Additionally, he was not the only scientist studying tartrates in search of new discoveries with this substance (Gal, 2017). It is now thought that Pasteur's ability to see what other scientists had missed was his natural artistic abilities. As a teenager, Pasteur drew in several mediums, such as charcoal and lithography, at least 40 human portraits of friends and was considered accomplished and respected by other senior artists of the period, such as Albert Edelfelt (Gal, 2017). Pasteur's driving force, similar to Burnell, was the scientific discovery in a purely academic sense. However, his artistic drive to see the structures presented in the chemical compounds as scenes to be reproduced in other mediums, similar to human portraits, enabled Pasteur to see what others could not and change the world of molecular chemistry (Gal, 2017).

Coming out of the Rand corporation, Helmer and Dalkey created the framework around the results of questionnaires sent out in rounds to experts on the subject pertaining to the needed decision (Rowe \u0026amp; Wright, 2001). The main advantage of the methodology is the aggregation of anonymous expert responses with response alterations. The main disadvantage is the lack of live real-time response and feedback (Twin, 2020). The data and process of decision determinations from the Delphi technique is considered qualitative in nature do to the evaluation of opinions (Rowe \u0026amp; Wright, 2001). One other decision making technique for groups is based on qualitative data analysis is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Partovi, Burton, \u0026amp; Banerjee, 1990). The AHP process involves the creation of a hierarchical relationship structure based on data from people or processes. This structure should represent the underlying decision making problem and the relationships should have pairwise values for descriptions. The creation of the hierarchical structure is similar to the Delphi technique of expert survey rounds but with more upfront emphasis on the focus of each level (Saaty, 1987). The key difference is the accumulation of the pairwise relationship weights or values between the nodes of the structure in AHP. This allows for the formulation of dominance matrices from which the analytical analysis can derive a decision making path for the solution (Saaty, 1987). Finally, for more directed group decision making problems, quantitative processes can be formulated as novel solutions. Examples of this type of novel group decision making processes will translate systematic and qualitative data into quantitative sets using fuzzy logic systems (Sun, Wei, Wu, \u0026amp; Jing, 2020). The example from Sun, et al. (2020) illustrates the use of data from different organizations within an airport operations for group decisions regarding new and existing operational risks. The analysis will still use pairwise relationship matrices, as found in AHP, but with analytics focused on multi-criteria ranking and use of simulation models, for example Monte-Carlo, for statistical inferences that establish the decision solution (Sun, et al., 2020).\nReferences: Rowe, G., \u0026amp; Wright, G.
