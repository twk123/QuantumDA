The “Emerging Technologies & Practices and Influential Trends” document and mind map present an overview of the technologies and trends that will be shaping the practices and technologies used in the higher education community (2020 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, 2020). This diagram and report show an interesting emergence of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)  technology in education related systems. The Educause information also presents the social trend of equity and fair practice for educational systems. This blog post will outline where AI is emerging and a driving force behind this emergence. The post will also present an example of a social trend that utilizes AI technology as the enabler with ethical treatment as the driving force.

##### AI/Machine Learning Technology

The Educause document and diagram expose AI and the subset of Machine Learning (ML) as an emerging technology for educational use in 2020 (2020 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, 2020).  The Educause reports identifies the areas of learning management systems (LMS), library services, mobile products, student information systems (SISs) and automatic captioning systems as demonstrations of increasing ML activity. The ML activity is present in the capacity of automation within the previously identified areas (2020 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, 2020).  Not surprising is the economical force behind the push for ML in automation, both as applied in the educational setting as well as in general organizations (Zeide, 2019). As ML can increase the effectiveness of automation through improved accuracy which in turn can increase the productivity of human activities for increase in organizational value (How AI, Machine Learning, 2017).

##### Social Trends
A great example of AI/ML in the educational space is the use of ML for the automation of captioning or transcription of audio and video files (Solís, 2019). This example of AI/ML application follows social trend as identified in the Educause diagram (2020 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, 2020). This trend has a driving force of ethical treatment or fair use practice for students with disabilities (Solís, 2019).
