A childhood tool most of us have grown up with is Play-Doh. Play-Doh seems perfectly invented for the use we know and love today, a child safe modeling clay. However, the original intended use or discovery for this substance was as non-vinyl wall paper cleaner. As such, Play-Doh was an example of a discovery made by exaptation (Hiskey, 2015). Exaptation is a term used to describe an invention or discovery of use for a previously found discovery or invention (Ferreira et al., 2020). In the case of Play-Doh, the original Kutol’s wallpaper cleaner was used as modeling clay in a nursery school desperate for cheap material to use for making Christmas decorations (Hiskey, 2015). The story of the discovery of Play-doh is also one of an accidental discovery that repurposed the original invention use. However, accidental discovery have been classified as serendipitous discoveries and so in the case of Play-doh the two intertwine (Ferreira et al., 2020).
<p>The term “serendipity” was first used by Horace Walpole in 1794. Serendipity was used to describe discoveries that occurred as the result of an accident or unexpected or unanticipated result from research either in the primary field or an unrelated field (Roberts, 1989). The happy accident for the discovery of pulsars was first made by Jocelyn Bell Burnell while a graduate student at Cambridge University in the field of radio astronomy (Shackle, 2015). The discovery of pulsars, which are neutron stars rotating with a tremendous velocity that emit beams of radio waves, has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century (Burnell, 2004). 
<p>Additionally, discoveries can be made in error, in other words research down a particular line of methodology or questioning is not accurately followed. A mistake or error is made and an invention or discovery is made by the introduction of this error. A famous example of this process is the breakfast cereal “Wheaties” (Donnelly, 2012). The clumsy dietician at the Washburn Crosby Company spilled bran gruel on a hot stove top and noticed that the gruel turned or baked into flakes. The most surprising outcome from this culinary error was that the flake tasted better than the gruel (Donnelly, 2012). In hind sight, that should not have been that surprising.
