<b>Sun Microsystems</b>
<p>During the Internet bubble from around 1998 through the year 2000, Sun Microsystems was an unstoppable force in the web server market (Gomes, 2012). Sun was born from a confluence of industry Unix partners and governmental support of university internet research. By using this confluence of knowledge and recent advances in off the shelf components, such as Reduced Instruction Set Computation (RISC) processors from Motorola, Sun was able to build a unique and valuable set of products for hosting internet services (Gomes, 2012). Sun had a marketing plan that included not only great hardware and software, including eventually the creation of the Java language, but also a charismatic personality leader to market new products (Gomes, 2012). However, the technology advancements in central processing units (CPUs) that had initially born startup fruit for SUN using the RISC platform was the same type of technological introduction that eventually became Sun's downfall. In this case, the Intel company was able to advance the performance and with a lower cost of the competing Complex Instruction Set Computation (CISC) processors (CISC vs RISC, n.d.). Intel's innovation and cost reduction lead to Sun Microsystems' downfall as a primary internet provider (Gomes, 2012).
<p><b>Quantum Computers</b>
<p>Quantum computing is a technology innovation that has not been fully developed yet. At this beginning stage of innovation development, two competing methodologies of quantum computers have emerged, that of the quantum annealing process and the quantum gate-level process (Eric & Finke, 2020). Although quantum annealing is not a universal quantum computer, currently optimization problems finding local minima is the specialization. The quantum-gate can solve a border range of problems but can compete in the optimization problem space (Ohzeki, 2020). The D-Wave company is pursuing the quantum annealing with competition from IBM and others seeking the quantum gate-level process for computations (Eric & Finke, 2020; Linke, et al., 2017). D-Wave needs a sociotechnical plan to compete and ensure the organization's long-term viability, which accounts for the technological force against it from the quantum-gate organizations (Ohzeki, 2020; Baxter & Sommerville, 2011). D-Wave does not want to repeat the mistakes of Sun Microsystems and not have a technological counter for quantum-gate solutions. Secondly, the economics force will need to be considered an integral part of the sociotechnical plan, as with all computational devices, the cost will be driven downward (Eric & Finke, 2020).
