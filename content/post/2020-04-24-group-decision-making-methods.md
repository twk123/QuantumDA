The Delphi technique or method for group decision-making was formulated in the 1950s. Coming out of the Rand corporation, Helmer and Dalkey created the framework around the results of questionnaires sent out in rounds to experts on the subject pertaining to the needed decision (Rowe & Wright, 2001). The main advantage of the methodology is the aggregation of anonymous expert responses with response alterations. The main disadvantage is the lack of live real-time response and feedback (Twin, 2020). 
The data and process of decision determinations from the Delphi technique is considered qualitative in nature do to the evaluation of opinions (Rowe & Wright, 2001). One other decision making technique for groups is based on qualitative data analysis is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Partovi, Burton, & Banerjee, 1990). 
The AHP process involves the creation of a hierarchical relationship structure based on data from people or processes. This structure should represent the underlying decision making problem and the relationships should have pairwise values for descriptions. The creation of the hierarchical structure is similar to the Delphi technique of expert survey rounds but with more upfront emphasis on the focus of each level (Saaty, 1987). The key difference is the accumulation of the pairwise relationship weights or values between the nodes of the structure in AHP. This allows for the formulation of dominance matrices from which the analytical analysis can derive a decision making path for the solution (Saaty, 1987).
Finally, for more directed group decision making problems, quantitative processes can be formulated as novel solutions. Examples of this type of novel group decision making processes will translate systematic and qualitative data into quantitative sets using fuzzy logic systems (Sun, Wei, Wu, & Jing, 2020). The example from Sun, et al. (2020) illustrates the use of data from different organizations within an airport operations for group decisions regarding new and existing operational risks. The analysis will still use pairwise relationship matrices, as found in AHP, but with analytics focused on multi-criteria ranking and use of simulation models, for example Monte-Carlo, for statistical inferences that establish the decision solution (Sun, et al., 2020).
