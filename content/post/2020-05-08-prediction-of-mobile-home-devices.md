<p>When forecasting or making a prediction of the future of technological innovation, how does one define variable characteristics of technological innovation? Dimensions are thought to be necessary for evaluation when making a prediction or forecasting a scenario of possible future outcomes involving technological innovation (Quinn, 2014; Daim, Rueda, Martin, & Gerdsri, 2006). However, technology should be evaluated as knowledge of relationships, not the physical device. These knowledge relationships often reflect the corroborating or conflicting forces that can impact the success or failure of the predicted outcome for innovation (Quinn, 2014). 
An excellent example of understanding the impacting forces of technological innovation in predicting the future comes from the science fiction author Issac Asimov. In 1983 Asimov made the following innovation prediction for the year 2019: 
<p>“The "mobile computerized object" will "penetrate the home," and the increasing complexity of society will make it impossible to live without this technology.” (Johnson, 2019). 
<p>Not only is the prediction wildly accurate for today’s modern lifestyle, but it also identifies the impacting forces of influence (Bradford, 2020). One of the forces is the advancement of technology concerning mobile devices. Even in 1983, the pace for more advanced mobile devices was advancing (Johnson, 2019). The second impacting force was the societal adoption of mobile technology as a means to simplify the increasing complexities of the Information Age lifestyle (Johnson, 2019). In this prediction instance the forces were corroborating in the success of the device a lot of people now refer to as “Hey Alexis” (Bradford, 2020).
<p>As a counterpoint to the successful prediction, Asimov’s following prediction: 
<p>"By 2019, the first space settlement should be on the drawing boards; and may perhaps be under actual construction," <p>was not as successful (Johnson, 2019). In this instance, one of the underlying forces of impact, the technological innovation in space travel, was influenced by the changing management culture of NASA (Howell, 2019). A change in the knowledge relationships of space travel that resulted in a tragedy from which the space travel sector if just now starting to recover (Clark, 2020).
