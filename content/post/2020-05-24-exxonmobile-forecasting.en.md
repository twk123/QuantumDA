<p>One method for developing a strategic plan for an organization is scenario planning. The scenario planning process can be used by the organization to define a set of possible future outcomes for the future of the organization (Wade, 2012). To create this set of possible future results, the organization must first identify the driving forces for the organization's desired behavior. These forces can be technology emergence, shifts in economics, or politics, to name a few (Lew, Meyerowitz, & Svensson, 2018). Next, the organization needs to identify which of the driving forces are more critical to impact the organization. The assignment of a range of possible values for the identified impacting forces should be developed next. Finally, a set of strategies can be developed by the designated organizational scenario planners (Lew, et al., 2018). The primary strength of the scenario planning method is the ability to identify a range of plausible outcomes without the need for a broad set of historical data, either quantitative or qualitative (Amer, Daim, & Jetter, 2013). However, the information used for the critical driving force ranges of values can be subjective and prone to inaccuracies. Additionally, the initial set of driving forces could be too extensive with biased or subjective strategy session selections from the organizational planners that do not correctly identify possible future states (Lew, et al., 2018).
<p><b>Traditional Forecasting</b>
<p>For the process of forecasting, the organization will attempt to collect both quantitative and qualitative data in the service of a prediction formulation. The organization might use surveys or decision-making methodologies, such as the Delphi method for qualitative data (Daim, Rueda, Martin, & Gerdsri, 2006; Rowe & Wright, 2001). Business metrics such as time series sales growth or lead-lag indicators could be a few of the quantitative data collection. The prediction formulation will tend to use statistical modeling and data analytics methodologies (Daim et al., 2006). The accuracy of predictions formulated in this traditional forecasting methodology is highly dependent on the veracity of the data and the use of the statical and analytic processes (Wade, 2012). The prediction power of forecasting has been shown to achieve good results for organizations and offers a structured and repeatable process (Wade, 2012). However, the forecasting accuracy will suffer when forces, both external and internal, that shaped the values of historical quantitative and qualitative data, alter significantly in the future. 
<p><b>Complementary combination</b>
<p>For the organization, planning for the most likely future state or outcome is critical for sustained optimum operations (Wade, 2012). A possible result from the examination of both the strengths and weaknesses of scenario planning and traditional forecasting that benefits the organization is a complementary combination of the two methodologies (Derbyshire & Giovannetti, 2017). The next section will highlight a case study of energy production forecasting that did not use a complementary combination of traditional forecasting and scenario planning.
<p><b>ExxonMobile Forecasting Case Study</b>
<p>The oil company ExxonMobile is part of the energy production industry. Analytical models are the norm from which forecasts are derived in this industry (Muttitt, 2017). An example of an analytical model for energy demand is shown in Figure 1. Forecasting for energy demand is extrapolated from drivers such as population, GDP per capita, and energy intensity. Although the extrapolation gives a quantitative rigor to the model and forecasting process, this process ultimately makes subjective assumptions about trend growth (Muttitt, 2017). These assumptions will tend to mask critical underlying trends that can have dramatic effects for a driver in the model formulation (Muttitt, 2017). As shown in Figure 2, the ExxonMoble energy demand model forecast for oil demand was off by at least 3% for year 2105. A 3% difference between actual and forecast might seem insignificant, but as can be seen in Figure 3, there was an error of at least 9 billion barrels of oil for 2015. ExxonMobile failed to incorporate scenario planning to account for new technology disruptions, such as a rise in alternative energy use and social impacts such as more energy conservation measures. By assuming the future will be like the present, ExxonMobile failed to scenario plan for a world that would need 9 billion fewer barrels of oil (Muttitt, 2017).
