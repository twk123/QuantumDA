<p>The term “serendipity” was first used by Horace Walpole in 1794. Serendipity was used to describe discoveries that occurred as the result of an accident or unexpected or unanticipated result from research either in the primary field or an unrelated field (Roberts, 1989). This report illustrates two groundbreaking discoveries in science that happened by accident. One of these discoveries is shown to be the result of the unrelated artistic sensibilities of the scientist. The first is a pure form of a happy accident.</p>

##### Serendipitous Discovery of Pulsars

<p>The happy accident for the discovery of pulsars was first made by Jocelyn Bell Burnell while a graduate student at Cambridge University in the field of radio astronomy (Shackle, 2015). The discovery of pulsars, which are neutron stars rotating with a tremendous velocity that emit beams of radio waves, has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century (Burnell, 2004). However, the discovery of this very interesting astronomical observance was made by Burnell, noticing a pattern in the noise surrounding the intended astronomical observation subject. Burnell and her advising professor were puzzled by the regularity of the radio pulses that had never before been seen as natural phenomena. At first, the possibility of alien intelligence as a cause for this unnatural observation as hypothesized, but after more searching, for these radio pulses, the events could be seen as natural occurrences (Shackle, 2015). Observations of pulsars lead to a deeper understanding of the life stars and one of the more bizarre outcomes for stars (Burnell, 2004). 
<p>Radio astronomy is an academic endeavor with a primary motivating force of scientific curiosity. However, even purely academic work needs funding, and the scientific world is ripe with competitive prizes as a secondary force for discovery behaviors (Burnell, 2004). The work for the discovery of pulsars was awarded the first Nobel prize in physics for an astronomical discovery in 1974. Although Burnell was not on the awarded team as she was a student at the time of discovery, she later used this as motivation to inspire other female researchers to join the astronomical sciences (Burnell, 2004).
Burnell's discovery, although considered as accidental, could be attributed to the attention to detail she paid in researching her work (Burnell, 2004). This ability to discover science in the peripheral view of the main objective is considered a possible explanation of serendipitous discovery in science-related fields (Roberts, 1989).

##### Serendipitous Discovery of Molecular Chirality
<p>Louis Pasteur was made famous in modern society by the discovery of the pasteurization method (Roberts, 1989). As a French microbiologist and chemist, he made significant contributions across these fields. However, it was Pasteur's serendipitous discovery in the field of chemistry that is considered his most significant contribution to science (Flack, 2009). Pasteur was studying tartaric acid at the University of Paris when he noticed a particular symmetry in the tartrates, which ultimately lead to the field of molecular chirality (Gal, 2017). His discovery is considered surprising or serendipitous as he was new to this field of study, being only 25 years of age and just a few months from finishing his doctorate.
<p>Additionally, he was not the only scientist studying tartrates in search of new discoveries with this substance (Gal, 2017). It is now thought that Pasteur's ability to see what other scientists had missed was his natural artistic abilities. As a teenager, Pasteur drew in several mediums, such as charcoal and lithography, at least 40 human portraits of friends and was considered accomplished and respected by other senior artists of the period, such as Albert Edelfelt (Gal, 2017). 
<p>Pasteur's driving force, similar to Burnell, was the scientific discovery in a purely academic sense. However, his artistic drive to see the structures presented in the chemical compounds as scenes to be reproduced in other mediums, similar to human portraits, enabled Pasteur to see what others could not and change the world of molecular chemistry (Gal, 2017).
